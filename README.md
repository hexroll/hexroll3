# HEXROLL 3

This is the new work-in-progress version of HEXROLL (https://hexroll.app) - the OSR sandbox generator.

## Currently Included

- hexroll3-scroll: the core content generator
- hexroll3-scroll-data: the new data model, based on the hexroll2e model
- hexroll3-testbed: an egui application for testing and messing around

You can look at each part to see how it all works.

## Running the testbed

Make sure you have `git` and an up-to-date Rust development environment, and then:

```
git clone https://github.com/hexroll/hexroll3 && cd hexroll3
cargo run --release
```

This should open up the testbed where you can generate your first sandbox:
